<p class="text">Each level inside the game in set up in a grid like mannor where each charactor on the playing feild can move within that grid. You can disperse up to 10 people in each level and each player can move and attack for each of the player's turn. The level ends when all of the opposing enemies die, which will gain you money and mana. There are 14 chapters in the game with about 5 levels within each chapter. Before and after each level, there is a visual novel-like cutscene that plays to continue the story. Outside of each level there is the hub where you talk to people to better you team. You can buy items, heal your party, look at your statistics, call the Dark Assembly, or go into the Item World. Starting off you can go to the shop where there are two sellers. One which sells offensive items while the other sells defensive items. These items range from guns, swords, axes, and monster weapons; to things like armor, hp heals, and stealing hands. Each items has its own rank with the higher the rank being the more effective of an item. Each type of item  ranged from a rank one to a rank fourty with there being 3 types of the rank 40 weapon with specific and difficult ways to get them. Not only that, but for each item there is common, rare, and legendary. The Hospital is where you go to spend a certain amount of money to heal of your characters. Also, dpending on how many deaths, hp, and sp you've healed you can rewards from the hospital.
