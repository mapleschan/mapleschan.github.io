<h2 class="text">The Plot</h2>
	<img src="prinny.jpg" />
<p class="text">The story of the game takes place in Hell. There is the main character, Laharl, who has been sleeping for over 2 years. The scene starts with his vassle, Etna, trying to wake him up with a bunch of deadly weapons. Finally, he wakes up and learns about the news of that his father has died. Laharl speaks with his vassles, and decides to go to Vyers' castle. After defeating said demon, an angel comes to assassinate Laharl's father, not knowing hes already dead. The angel, Flonne, is suprised at how uncaring Laharl is about his father's death, and thus decides to stick around to figure out if demons can actually can feel love or not. Unknowingly to them, Archangel Vulcanus figures out about this and starts to believe that Flonne is teaming up and is planning on taking over Celestia. Etna complains to Laharl that the Prinnies, the lowest of the low in terms of vassles, arent being paid enough for their duties. So, Laharl plans to attack the most richest person in the netherworld, Hoggmeiser. After defeating him, Laharl planned on killing him before being interrupted by Hoggmeiser's son. Fortunatly, Flonne persuades Laharl to spare them. Later, an embarassing picture was found of Laharl with a letter explaining how it will be used to blackmal Laharl into coming to a challenge for overlordship. The blackmailer turns out to be Maderas, a vampire who the King casted out because Maderas stole his favorite snack, black pretzels. Maderas took advantage of exposing Laharl's weaknesses but also was controlling Enta by stealing her memories and promising her to give them back once the prince was dead. She had tried poisoning him, but instead it just put him to sleep for two years. Laharl and his friends then defeat him. Later that night, Flonne wake sup to the sound of singing Prinnies who were leaving the castle. Laharl chases after them, but is stopped by Big Sis Prinny. The player finds out that this Prinny is actually Laharl's mother who died and became a prinny when she sacraficed herself to save her son. Laharl talks to death and Big Sis who persuade him to let the prinnies go. Later, Laharl hears of something happening nearby. He goes there and finds out its s group of humans. Captain Gordon, the defender of Earth, Jennifer, his ally, and Thursday, their robot. They were sent there to assassinate Laharl under the belief that he was planning on destroying Earth. Laharl makes a deal with Gordon to not destroy earth if Gordon defeats him, but only if Gordon becomes one of his vassle. But when the Earth Defence Force comes it is revealed that Gordon's mission was actually to secure a path for the netherworld to be invaded by the humans, who were tricked by Vulcanus. General Carter, the general of Earth, sends Kurtis, another defender of Earth, to the netherworld. And leter the General goes there himself inside of a spaceship called the Space Battleship Gargantua.Kurtis abducts Jennifer and takes him back to the spaceship, which Laharl responds with by defeating everyone on the spaceship. Once he gets to the bridge of the Gargantua the General escapes and Vyers appears to give the General a message. Flonne and the rest of the party then goes to Celestia to confront Seraph Lamington. Vulcanus also goes to the Seraph and states that Flonne is a traiteor who plans to use an army of demons to take over Celestia. He also reveals that his plan is to use his army to take over all three worlds and rule over all three of them as a god. Laharl defeats Vulcanus and they finally meet the Seraph where Flonne explains what she has learned and what Vulcanus' plan is. The Seraph agrees that demons are capable of feeling loved and that her accepts her version of what happened. Although, he also explains how that because she has slain other angels, she must be punished. Flonne gets turned into a flower, which causes Laharl to go into an outrage and attacks the Seraph. At this point the ending of the game can change depending on how youve played the game so far. The possible outcomes invilve, the Seraph may or may not survive, Flonne either remains a flower, is restored to her original form, or is transformed into a Fallen Angel, and Laharl either becomes a great Overlord, disappears and leaves Etna in charge of the Netherworld, or dies and becomes a Prinny. On the good ending, sthe spirit of Laharl's mother speaks to him, and Vyers acts as if he already knows her, and the way he talks to Laharl suggests that he is King Krichevskoy.</p>
