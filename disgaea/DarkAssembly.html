<p class="text"> At the Dark Assembly you can can call for certain proposals to be made and npc's will vote on weather or not to pass it. You can bribe these senators to be able to win the vote as they have a predetermined bias on you based on your actions in the game, or you can go without any bribary and win or fail. If you fail, you are given the option to give up, or force the bill to be passed. If you force it then the room will be turned into a battle level where you will have to fight all of the senators and if you defeat them all the bill will be passed. Although, forcing bills can be bad in the long run as everytime you kill a senator, their opinion on you gets worse and worse. Despite all of that, there is a lot you can do with the dark assembly such as: make enemies stronger, access or items to buy at the shop, gain access to postgame levels to better you team, and much more. For each bill in the assembly you must spend a certain amount of mana to start the voting the process, but you have to be careful because if you fail the vote, there is no refund to your mana. Another thing you can do is make new general units using the dark assembly. There are a number of classes in Disgaea and you can name them whatever you want. You will be using these characters throughout the whole , the only other characters being the story characters.</p>
